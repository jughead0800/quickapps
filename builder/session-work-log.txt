==================================
Date: Session work completed
Repository: QuickAPPS

OVERVIEW
--------
This document outlines all work completed in this session to set up the QuickAPPS 
project with automated index generation and CI/CD pipeline.

COMPLETED TASKS
---------------

1. GENERALIZED INVOICE APP SETTINGS
   - Updated invoiceapp.html to remove "True Frontier" specific placeholders
   - Changed Business Name placeholder from "True Frontier Pty Ltd" to "Your Business Name"
   - Changed Address placeholder from "58 Gawler Place, Adelaide SA 5000" to generic format
   - Changed Phone placeholder from Australian format to generic international format
   - File: invoiceapp.html

2. CREATED LANDING PAGE
   - Created index.html as the main landing page for QuickAPPS
   - Implemented dark theme matching file-compare.html style
   - Added intro section explaining what QuickAPPS are
   - Added features list highlighting privacy and simplicity
   - Added app cards for each application
   - File: index.html

3. ADDED FOOTER LINKS
   - Added Discord link: https://discord.true-frontier.com
   - Added Buy Me a Coffee link: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/truefrontier
   - Styled footer links with hover effects matching theme
   - File: index.html

4. REORGANIZED PROJECT STRUCTURE
   - Created apps/ folder
   - Moved file-compare.html to apps/
   - Moved invoiceapp.html to apps/
   - Moved Recipt Calc.html to apps/
   - All apps now organized in dedicated folder

5. CREATED BUILD SCRIPTS
   - Created build-index.sh (Bash/POSIX shell script)
     * Uses only basic POSIX commands (no external dependencies)
     * Extracts titles from HTML files using sed
     * Generates app cards with icons and titles
     * Works with busybox (Alpine Linux compatible)
   - Created build-index.ps1 (PowerShell alternative)
     * Same functionality as bash script
     * For Windows/local development
   - Both scripts scan apps/ folder and auto-generate index.html
   - Files: build-index.sh, build-index.ps1

6. SIMPLIFIED APP CARDS
   - Removed descriptions from app cards (per user request)
   - App cards now show only icon and title
   - Matches simpler design pattern from reference screenshot
   - Updated both build scripts accordingly

7. CREATED GITEA ACTIONS WORKFLOW
   - Created .gitea/workflows/build.yml
   - Automatically builds index.html when:
     * Files in apps/ folder are modified
     * build-index.sh is updated
     * build-index.ps1 is updated
     * Workflow file itself is updated
   - Uses actions/checkout@v3 (same pattern as working PowerShell build)
   - Runs on ubuntu-latest (no container needed)
   - Includes skip CI logic ([skip ci] in commit messages)
   - Only commits on push to main (not PRs)
   - Uses permissions: contents: write for push access
   - File: .gitea/workflows/build.yml

8. WORKFLOW TROUBLESHOOTING
   - Initially tried Alpine container (too minimal, no Node.js for checkout)
   - Switched to ubuntu-latest to match working build pattern
   - Used actions/checkout@v3 with token authentication
   - Followed same structure as workingbuild.yml reference
   - Final workflow tested and working with Gitea act runner

9. UPDATED README
   - Created comprehensive README.md
   - Documented project structure
   - Explained build process
   - Added manual build instructions
   - Documented CI/CD setup
   - File: README.md

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

Build Script Features:
- POSIX shell compatible (works with busybox)
- No external dependencies (only uses sed, cat, echo)
- Extracts titles from <title> tags in HTML files
- Maps filenames to icons (🔍 for file-compare, 📄 for invoice, 📋 for receipt)
- Generates clean HTML with proper escaping
- Handles files with spaces in names

Workflow Features:
- Automatic trigger on push to main branch
- Path-based triggering (only runs when relevant files change)
- Skip CI support ([skip ci] in commit messages)
- Conditional commits (only on push, not PRs)
- Uses GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication
- Configurable git author via variables (with fallbacks)
